## Introduction

This project is an exploration of linear regression with a single variable in the context of Canada. Linear regression is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step analysis and code.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [provide_dataset_link_here]. It includes [describe_dataset_content].

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explore the dataset, perform data cleaning, and gain insights into the data using EDA techniques. Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory provide a detailed analysis.

## Linear Regression Model

The project builds a simple linear regression model to predict or analyze a specific variable based on a single feature.

## Results and Visualizations

The project includes visualizations and results to help interpret the findings. Check the `notebooks/` directory for detailed visualizations.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
